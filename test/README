Network related tests, jsx3.net.Request, jsx3.net.Service, jsx3.net.Form, jsx3.gui.NativeForm need
to have the test/server CGI and PHP scripts enabled for execution.

Using Apache, make sure that you have ExecCGI enabled and PHP module enabled.

On Linux/Mac, you also need to make sure that the execution bit are set with 'chmod 755'

To run Jasmine specs, launch gi-spec.html

To add a new test suite, create a new JavaScript file in the tests/jasmine
directory. Define the test specs with describe() and it()
method. Finally, add a reference to the new JavaScript test file in the
tests/jasmine/suite.js file.

This test suite can also be run from an HTTP server.
